order to identify and analyze sub-halos that constitute the bigger halos given to me by the halo catalog produced from the aforementioned project. now, when i run the rockstar algorithm it returns a “dataset” like object having some fields, like particle_position_x particle_velocity_x etc. so regarding these fields i was wandering how were they produced. for example, the position is given as the position of the center of mass of the particles in this particular subhalos? and the velocity is it mass weighted or not? thank you in advance for your reply.'], ['<@uelt6g0f6> welcome!  i believe the

stands the question is not very much related to yt. but yt gets involved in the next step. that is, when i invoke the halo finder to find the subhalos i then use the halocatalog object of yt to analyze the results. in particular i feed the halocatalog with the rockstar output and the original data set of the whole halo and apply some filters; for example i ask for halos with mass &gt; 10^13 solar masses. here is where my real problem starts. i compare the particle identifier field of the rockstar_ds and the catalog_ds and find that indeed every id in the catalog_ds already exists in the rockstar_ds as it should. but when i do this for the particle position field or the particle velocity fields i find a discrepancy. for example only half of the values in the catalog_ds match the ones in rockstar_ds. so i guess that when i used the halocatalog object it changed some of the values in position and velocity. i could just proceed and analyze the output of the halo catalog but i want to

year ago in the yt4 branch.\\n--the problem occurs for any of the particle-based datasets that i’ve tested, both from gizmo and gadget frontends.\\n--presumably this is due to an ambiguous fieldname access, since gadget and gizmo datasets both have derived fields for `('gas', 'density')` as well as `('parttype0', 'density')` .  my guess is that when the derivedquantity is being called on this data, some of the chunks are being processed on the `('gas', 'density')` field, which returns in cgs and some of the chunks are being called on the `('parttype0', 'density')` field which returns in code_units.  then `ds.arr` doesn’t know how to combine the quantities with different units.  presumably this will occur for all derived quantities.\\n--notably, this problem goes away if you first calculate a derivedquantity on *one* of the gas density fields using the full tuple first: e.g.,\\n```_, c = ds.find_max(('gas', 'density'))\\n_, c = ds.find_max('density')```\\npresumably because it already has `('gas', 'density')` in its cache from the first function call before trying to do the second function call.\\n\\nso in the end, it looks like the problem could be resolved with code to address this issue: <https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues/1467> .  i’m happy to work on this.  i guess maybe whenever a field access is called, it should check the derived_field_list if there are any ambiguities and error out if there are?  this would be done in the `fieldinfocontainer`?\"], ['the data we have suppose the enzo_cosmology_plus.tar.gz, i wish to create a field and calculate the
